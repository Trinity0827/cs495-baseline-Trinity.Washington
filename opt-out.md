# Opt-Out Statement

I chose not to do Step 3, Option 2 for this assignment.
The part that feels hard for me right now is Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions. 
CI means that every time you push code to GitHub, it will automatically run tests to check if the code still works.
This is very helpful for teams, but I have never set up GitHub Actions before, and the YAML files it uses look confusing to me.
I have used unittest and pytest before in a class during my sophomore year, but I haven’t used them since. Because of that, I feel out of practice writing tests and reading the results. 
Trying to connect those tests into GitHub’s CI system feels like too big of a step for me right now at the start of the semester.

## My plan
- Practice writing simple tests with unittest` and `pytest on my own again.  
- Get comfortable running them locally and making sure I understand how they pass or fail.  
- After that, I want to look at tutorials to learn how **GitHub Actions** works.  
- Work with my capstone team later to set up CI/CD together once I understand it better.
I know CI/CD is important in the real world, and I want to learn it. For now, I want to rebuild my testing skills in Python first before I try to use GitHub Actions.
